## K Nearest Neighbor Theory
KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm for regression and classification problem. It uses data to classify new data points based on similarity measures (example: distance function). In KNN classification, a new data point is classified by the plurality vote of its neighbors, with the data point being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer). 

## Dataset
This is a Glass Identification Data Set from UCI. The main objective of the analysis is to classify data points based on their glass type with K Nearest Neighbor Classifier.<br />
